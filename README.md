### Rengu

Rengu is a content management framework that puts metadata and NLP capabilities first.

### Prajna

Prajna is a collection of content (managed in a Rengu instance). It is primarily religious and spiritual texts.
The aim is to use NLP to test (or at least explore) the
[Perennialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy) hypothesis.
